Dear friends and all,

Welcome to my website! On this auspicious day, we start our journey towards a better future - One that has individual independence written on it.
No longer shall we be bound by old age impotence, no longer shall we fear growing old. 

Needless to say, the road ahead is long and arduous, fraught with difficulties and obstacles. However, we shall toil and rage against these!

So comrades, onwards we march!
